		<p>In Go you cannot just fire and forget a function. Failing to handle the return
types could lead your program to fail. It is quite easy, for instance, to leak
file descriptors. This is very, very bad for long-running or high throughput
processes. Check for leaks.</p>

<p>Consider a web server built to provide a REST API to
some other tool. Our example is for a message broker, but this could be any
software you want to proxy or apply a standard interface to. Users send CRUD
requests to the server and a client library does the heavy lifting. The
following code is being called when the server receives a DELETE request
for an app:</p>

<pre><code>func (s *Server) Disconnect(req Request) error {

  ...

  resp, err = s.Client.DeleteUser(req.User)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  defer resp.Body.Close()

  connections, err := s.client.ListConnections()
  if err == nil {
    for _, connection := range connections {
      if connection.User == req.User {
        s.client.CloseConnection(connection.Name)
      }
    }
  }

  ...

  return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each app has an associated user in the broker. Over the lifetime of that
user they may have created any number of independent connections (e.g. message
queues). We want to delete the associated user. We then check for orphaned
connections and close them one by one.</p>

<p>The problem is that we&rsquo;ve forgotten to consider the response type of
<code>CloseConnection</code>. <code>ListConnections</code> returns a struct generated in the client
libary. But <code>CloseConnection</code> just forwards the HTTP response from the broker.
The documentation for &ldquo;net/http&rdquo; states:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the returned error is nil, the Response will contain a non-nil Body which
the user is expected to close. If the Body is not both read to EOF and closed,
the Client&rsquo;s underlying RoundTripper (typically Transport) may not be able to
re-use a persistent TCP connection to the server for a subsequent &ldquo;keep-alive&rdquo;
request.&rdquo;</p>

<p><code>Response.Body</code> implements an <code>io.Reader</code> so that the <a href="https://golang.org/src/net/http/response.go">&ldquo;response
body is streamed on demand as the Body field is
read&rdquo;</a>. This way the response can be
piped to a decoder and avoid buffering very long messages in memory.  But this
also means the client has to explicitly decide when it has finished with the
stream. Some other languages (e.g.
<a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Net/HTTP.html#class-Net::HTTP-label-Streaming+Response+Bodies">ruby</a>)
read the entire message into memory by default and have a different syntax for
streaming.</p>

<p>Every call to <code>CloseConnection</code> opens a file descriptor. If the response body
is not closed, that file descriptor will never be closed. In fact, it will be
stuck in a state called <code>CLOSE_WAIT</code> indefinitely. The file descriptor
limit varies between kernels and can be altered but a common default for a
shell (<code>ulimit -n</code>) is 1024. If the processes spawned by that shell exceed its
FD limit, any attempt to open another one - in this case to open another TCP
socket - will fail with an <code>EMFILE (Too many open files)</code> error. And that&rsquo;s
basically you done. The process can be restarted. The ulimit can be set higher.
 But the problem will persist until the source of the leak is fixed. We need to
 handle the response and error of <code>CloseConnection</code> and close the response body:</p>

<pre><code>  resp, err := s.client.CloseConnection(connection.Name)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  defer resp.Body.Close()
</code></pre>

<p>This bug is a slow burn. Unless your CI includes some kind of very high
throughput perf test, you&rsquo;re unlikely to run out of file descriptors before you
ship. Without a properly configured long running environment, the only place
this will manifest itself is in prod. This is bad enough for a server you
mantain. In the very worst case you&rsquo;ll have an incident, get paged in the
middle of the night to restart the server and maybe bump the ulimit so that you
can fix it in the morning. If you ship it as a binary your only option will be
to ship a new release.</p>

<p>Beyond trying your very hardest to not make this mistake (ever), consider the
failure modes of the application you&rsquo;re trying to build. Test for them where
possible. If you&rsquo;re building a web server, this should include testing for file
descriptor leaks. Check <code>lsof</code> for TCP connections in <code>CLOSE_WAIT</code> after
your end to end test run. Or if you&rsquo;re feeling minimalist, you can check
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/proc_net_tcp.txt">/proc/net/tcp</a>
for connections from your server&rsquo;s port (in hexadecimal) that have connection
state 8 (<code>CLOSE_WAIT</code>).</p>
